After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

I would call the orange group "mid" as they make average money and spend average moeny. I would call the red group "brokies" as they make the least money and are the cheapest. I would call the purple group "Debt" as they will probably go in debt with their spending. I would call the blue group "Generational" as they have generational wealth so they could spend lots of money. I would call the green group "cheapskates" as they have the money but won't spend it.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

They would be in the orange group.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

I would go for the blue group as they spend a lot of money ana are rich. I would market my product as something that looks like a rich person would have and be super expensive. They would probably would want it as they are most attracted to the rich looking things and the pricetag.
