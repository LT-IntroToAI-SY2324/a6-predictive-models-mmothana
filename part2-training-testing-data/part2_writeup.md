# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

This model had more data which made it more effective than the previous model as more data is going to make predictons more accurate.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The r-squared coefficient is 0.73 which means the r value is around  0.85. This tells me that this model is quite accurate as it is close to 1 and more accurate then the previous model.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

This model is accurate because the plotted data and best fit line it created looks like the data would fit in.
