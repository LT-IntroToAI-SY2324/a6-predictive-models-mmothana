# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r squrared value is the correlation between two things, the closer they are the more similar the two would be.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

137.46

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think the model's predictions are accurate enough to show what people should expect at the age but at the same time, a person's life decisions from the day they are born is what causes higher or lower blood pressure. If someone lives a healthy life, they'll usually have an average or even lower blood pressure for their age which would be the opposite if they live an unhealthy one. But I would still not change the model as it's not supposed to show a 100% accuarate blood pressure.
